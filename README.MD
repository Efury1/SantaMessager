## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**

Ensure the following are installed on your system:
- **Node.js**: For running the React frontend.
- **.NET Core SDK**: For building and running the backend.
- **Yarn** (or **npm**): For managing frontend dependencies.

### **Installation**

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/username/ZProfit.git
    cd ZProfit
    ```

2. Install frontend dependencies:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    yarn install
    ```

3. Install backend dependencies:
    ```bash
    cd ../backend
    ```

4. Install additional dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install react-router-dom
    npm install --save-dev @types/react-router

## **Developer Workflow**

### **Snippets for Speed**
- Use **JavaScript and TypeScript Nightly** for quick typing support.
- Utilize **ES7 React/Redux/GraphQL/React-Native snippets** for:
   - Component creation (`rfc`, `rcc`).
   - Redux connections (`rconnect`).
   - Hook snippets (`useState`, `useEffect`).

### **JSX Usage**
- Write components using JSX for a seamless blend of logic and UI.
- JSX will be compiled to React elements, allowing you to focus on structure and functionality without worrying about manual conversions.

### **Linting**
- Run **ESLint** regularly to catch potential bugs and maintain clean code:
   ```bash
   yarn lint
   ```
