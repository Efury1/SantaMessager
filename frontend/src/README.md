Explanation of Code
I document my code to help myself and others learn concepts, making it easier for beginners who read my GitHub.

Props is one concept.
Props are like tubes; they are a way of communicating data, passing it up and down.
We will use a card and pass data down because we don't want duplicates.

We create interfaces because they provide us with labels for our data, like checks and balances.

Functions
We can type the return and what we expect to get back, but React provides all the types for us.
We can do type checking in generic <>.
We can specify our return type in parameters.

State is a part of CRUD, which is creating, reading, updating, and deleting. We could describe CRUD as storing and manipulating data.

React has specific rules. We are using the predefined hooks, such as useState. useState provides a getter and setter. The getter allows you to get data into your page.
The setter allows you to set the data so that the page renders correctly.

We do events, we do this in react instead of having to do all work in javascript.
